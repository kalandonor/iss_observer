# iss_observer
Simple application to determine whether ISS is observable for you.

The application looks which daytime is it for you. ISS is only observable during night. And looks at which position ISS is right now compared to your position.

**TODO:**
- [ ] Give current location as parameter or find a free API which tells your position.
- [ ] Another option could be give your full address or just zipcode as a parameter. A free API should determine the correct position.
- [ ] Finish unittesting
